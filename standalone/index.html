## The Team

* **Willem Wyndham** (Rust, WebAssembly, NFTs), **Chad Ostrowski** (JavaScript, subgraphs, education, NFTs), **Jonathon Hammond** (Rust, NFTs), **Andrew Nickell** (Design), **Jenni Dinsmore** (Project Management), **Anil Kumar** (Rust, JavaScript)

* Well-loved conference speakers

* A collective 8 years experience working in NEAR ecosystem

* Creators/maintainers of **TENK** &amp; **Fayyr** NFT launchpads; **near-simulator** &amp; **near-workspaces-js** testing tools

---

## The Problem

* Growing a codebase from **hackathon proof-of-concept** to **full-scale, complex dapp** is hard.

* Most complex dapps require: 1. secure smart contracts (of their own, and/or pre-existing), 2. off-chain indexing, such as with Subgraphs, 3. robust frontends, 4. off-chain storage.

* No current documentation or tooling covers all of this. **There's no one tool to help builders create complex dapps**, with all parts included.

* **No blockchain gets this right.** When we say "no current documentation or tooling", we really mean none.

---

## The Solution

RAEN is...

- the Ruby on Rails of the Open Web: a framework for quickly shipping ambitious dapps

- apps &amp; infrastructure to find &amp; use pre-existing smart contracts

- no-code smart contract launcher

- low-code smart contract authoring tool (OpenZeppelin, but better)

---

## The Market

* **Now: all web3 builders**

* Later: web2 builders migrating to web3

---

## Landscape / Competitors

- **NEAR**: docs.near.org, near-sdk.io, near-examples, learn-near, Figment Learn, Pagoda's Dev Console, OpenRPC

- **Ethereum**: OpenZeppelin, Truffle Suite, Hardhat, Ape, Brownie, Web3j, Create Eth App, Scaffold-Eth, Alchemy, Foundry

- **Solana**: Solana Cookbook, Solana for Beginners Blog Post, soldev

- **Cosmos**: Ignite, cosmos-sdk

- **Cardano**: Plutus

# Progress

- Initial RAEN &amp; RAEN Admin tools launched 27 June 2022

- [raen.dev](https://raen.dev)

- [2-minute demo](https://twitter.com/raendev/status/1541383341160615936)

- Early users [love it](http://localhost:3000/#/rec.raendev.near/GetRecommendations)

  [<img alt="I've had several conversations with Chad and Willem and have found them impressive and helpful. I fully agree with the vision of RAEN and wish it were part of 'official' NEAR tools already. I think it ought to be a higher priority than many other projects I've seen being worked on. It's great for not just development workflow but also as teaching tool. Plus, it will make people build more thoughtful interfaces with better comments." src="img/rec.png" style="width: 550px" />](http://localhost:3000/#/rec.raendev.near/GetRecommendations)
