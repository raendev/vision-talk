ðŸŒ§ RAEN in NEAR's desert: tooling for ambitious Open Web apps
===========================

A talk about the current state of RAEN and a vision of what it could become.

The slides, contained in `index.html`, are built using [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which allows you to write your slides in nice simple markdown and turns them into beautiful, browser-powered slides complete with speaker notes. Read its readme to find out more about it.

There's lots of custom styling on the slides, found at the top of the `index.html` file.


Talk Description
================

The biggest gap in NEAR's current tooling & education exists between "hackathon Proof-of-Concept" and "full-scale app". How's a hacker to evolve a weekend project into a well-architected codebase that serves a userbase of millions? What are the best current patterns for building on the Open Web, and how can a builder upgrade to the latest patterns "for free", harnessing the research and development of the whole ecosystem, rather than re-performing the research themselves?

RAEN has already laid the foundation for tooling that answers these questions. We'll learn how it works now, where it's headed, how to get started (so easy!), and how to get involved.
